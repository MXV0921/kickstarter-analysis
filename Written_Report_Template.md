# Maximizing Excel Functionality to Analyze Kickstarter Data

## What Are Reasons to Use Excel Formulas

There is a large amount of data that has been provided regarding crowdfunding of projects totally unrelated to our client Louise's project. Through the use of various excel formulas, tables, and charts we can make this raw data more functional and easily understood. By eliminating extemporaneous data and focusing on the most important factors we can maximize the chance of success for her funding venture.

## How Can We Find Useful Data From A Raw Spreadsheet

The resulting data we has given us an ability to focus on variables that can directly impact the possible success of our client's project. The initial chart we were given would be very confusing for anyone trying to extrapolate information. Our goal is to organize, filter, and highlight the data that is most beneficial. When we are able to filter data it helps us to find attributes that will be the most functional on the project we are working on. Through creating sheets, sorting data, colorizing, and creating easily readable charts and graphs we can help present our findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data we received was over a period of time from 2009 until 2017. While reviewing the data we focused on two main variables, the date theater kickstarter projects were launched and the outcome of kickstarter fundraisers based on the goal of the fundraiser.

There are outside variables that may influence the success rate of certain projects that are not included in the raw data we were provided. Kickstarter allows certain projects to be featured, and their website also recommends projects that it believes the visitors to the website will help fund. Our raw data doesn't include these outside influences and without more information we cannot be sure how these spotlights may have affected our data set.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The greatest amount of Kickstarter fundraisers were launched between the months of May and August. These months also had the highest rates of success. May and June appear to be prime months to launch a campaign, as they resulted in over a 50% success rate.

December has the fewest campaigns launched as well as the highest failure rate of any month. We can infer that this is because consumers are focused on the holidays(travel, gifts, etc.) and do not have discretionary income to invest in projects during this time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Don't set the target too high. Projects with target over $40,000 have a higher failure rate than Kickstarters asking for lower dollar amounts.

The highest percentage of success are projects targeting $25,000-$30,000. If we were to expand our targeted range, $20,000 to $40,000 has a fairly strong success rate.

Projects requesting under $10,000 have a high success rate but is likely not enough financing to fund our customer's project.
